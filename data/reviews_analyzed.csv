Clearly speaking the Double Chicken Roll is not at all worth it. It was very dry and bland. The fried chicken bucket was as usual tasty but the frying was not proper at all. Lot of oil was left in the chicken ahe I could feel drinking oil. Chizza was good and tasty. Another problem here is the efficiency in management. Traditional ordering counters are not available here. Here they placed 3 self ordering screens. Out of which only one is working and that too is operated by the employee. That means only 1 ordering counter is available in the whole facility and it also defeats the purpose of self ordering.

Ci9DQUlRQUNvZENodHljRjlvT21oWGNqUm9WakpVY2toSWNYVkhRMmRYUkRSM2VYYxAB,"I am writing to share my disappointment regarding the ongoing poor experience I’ve faced at your KFC Civil Lines, Allahabad outlet. Over the past eight years, I have regularly visited this branch, hoping for improvement — unfortunately, there has been no visible change in quality, service, or hospitality.  Here are some specific issues: 1. Poor Quality of Chicken Especially on Wednesdays, the chicken served is often of very low quality — it tastes stale, is often poorly cooked, and lacks the standard flavor I’ve experienced in other cities. 2. Inconsistent Taste The taste and freshness of food served here do not match the standards of other KFC outlets in cities like Delhi or Lucknow It feels like a completely different restaurant, not part of the KFC brand. 3. Unprofessional Staff and Service The staff lacks professionalism. Many of them are often seen chatting behind the cash counter, ignoring customer service. Their hospitality and attentiveness are far below expectations. 4. Poor Serving Practices The chicken is often kept for a long time, and when served, it is barely warm and feels microwaved rather than freshly cooked. This greatly affects the overall dining experience.  As a loyal customer and fan of KFC, it’s extremely disappointing to see this lack of quality and care at one of your outlets. I sincerely urge the management to look into this matter seriously and take corrective steps — including staff training, quality control, and ensuring food freshness.  I hope to see real improvement soon.",3 months ago,2025-11-05 16:53:32.732456,1.0,Shibu M,3,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100083889817339195096/reviews?hl=en,,negative,0.483,0.52,1.21

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURmZ0xEaXN3RRAB,"KFC (Kentucky Fried Chicken) is a globally renowned fast-food chain, famous for its crispy fried chicken and quick service. Here's a detailed review of the place:  Pros:  1. Signature Taste: The ""11 herbs and spices"" recipe delivers consistently delicious fried chicken with a crispy exterior and juicy interior.  2. Variety: Apart from chicken, KFC offers burgers, wraps, rice bowls, and vegetarian options to cater to diverse preferences.  3. Ambience: Most outlets provide a clean, comfortable, and family-friendly environment.  4. Quick Service: Efficient order processing, especially with online and app-based options.  5. Global Standards: KFC maintains uniform quality and taste across its outlets worldwide.  1. Price: Slightly expensive compared to local fast-food options.  2. Health Concerns: Fried and calorie-rich food may not appeal to health-conscious customers.  3. Limited Customization: Menu customization options are limited.  4. Crowded at Peak Hours: Popular outlets often experience long waiting times during rush hours.  Who Should Visit?  Fast-Food Enthusiasts: People who love fried chicken or American fast food.  Families: A good place for casual dining with kids.  Quick Bites: Ideal for those looking for a fast and filling meal.  Try their iconic Bucket Meal for sharing with friends or family.

Firstly, the order took an unusually long time to arrive, which was frustrating. When the food finally arrived, it was lukewarm at best. The chicken was dry and lacked the signature flavor that KFC is known for. It felt like it had been sitting out for too long.  Additionally, the sides were underwhelming. The fries were soggy, and the coleslaw was bland and lacked freshness. I was expecting a satisfying meal, but instead, I felt like I had wasted my money.  To make matters worse, the packaging was subpar, with some items spilling out and making a mess. Overall, for Rs. 1800, I expected a much better quality of food and service. I left feeling unsatisfied and unlikely to order from KFC again anytime soon at prayagraj.

Difficult to easily get the needed information to make your decisions.  - Initially they forgot our order, and after reminding them again after 15 minutes they started with it. Please note the restaurant was effectively empty. They only had a 1-2 orders in total.  - They got our order wrong. They gave us wrong drinks (twice) and wrong side dish quantity.  - Even though the staff were polite, they were not professional enough. We didn't even get our bill among other things.

And of you are a first timer then its my humble request please don't go here and ruin your magic moment. KFC is a feel of mixed emotions for many people especially that fried chicken experience and these guys are just ruining it deliberately. KFC please do something and close this outlet.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ5dTRITFR3EAE,I have always loved the roll sections of the KFC but trust the Chef the twister rolls were the best. The size also as a matter of fact has been shortened I understand the prizing but not up to so much of extent. The krushers were great too but I don't know why the KFC outlet in our Prayagraj seems so deserted with employees and feels like such a sleepy place. Last but not the least the food served hot must be hot and cold must be cold as the golden rule of service says.  Best wishes from the Chef.😇,Edited a year ago,2025-11-05 16:53:57.066719,5.0,Akash,20,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103064520609392858536/reviews?hl=en,,positive,0.419,0.6,4.03
