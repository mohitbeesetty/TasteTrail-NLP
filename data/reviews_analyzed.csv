ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnTUNZMUpyX2ZnEAE,"I recently visited this McDonald's outlet and had a great time with my friends 😄. The food, as always, lived up to expectations—classic McAloo Tikki meal and a Korean Spicy Paneer burger 🍟🔥. No complaints at all. The service was quick, and the staff were working efficiently and gracefully 🙌. It's always inspiring to see such hardworking people, each bringing their own energy and beauty to the place 💫.  What made this visit truly memorable, however, was something—or rather, someone—unexpected 💭. Among the bustling crowd, I noticed a girl who genuinely stood out 💖. She seemed to be around my age and had this quiet charm that was impossible to ignore 🌸. I looked at her just briefly, twice maybe, but to my surprise, she looked back—and my friend noticed it too 👀. That simple exchange, just a glance, created a small moment of connection in the middle of an ordinary day 🌆.  I’m an artist 🎨, and sometimes, you come across a face that inspires you—that makes you want to capture the essence of it on paper 🖌️. Hers was one of those rare faces. I wish I had asked her if I could draw her. Not in a weird or forward way—just as an artist admiring a fleeting piece of beauty 🌈. But our order arrived, and I didn’t want to make her uncomfortable, so I left it at that and moved on 🍔.  Life has its own ways ✨. Maybe if the universe wills it, I’ll cross paths with her again.

I just wanted to say that what that male worker thinks he is ? I request McDonald's to take proper action towards these bad employees thak single handedly pull down the brand reputation to the drain, also if you don't have ingredients to make some order, just make the person taking orders check and tell that ""sir that particular item is currently unavailable"" it will save time and unnecessary interaction with you bad staff members. i am giving one star of review because zero option was not there, also you all upgraded the interior of the cafe, but missed the key part that is to hire a well behaved staff, that assist the customer not ignore or misbehave.",4 months ago,2025-11-04 16:07:04.101884,1.0,Vibhav Singh,25,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116978260393795892027/reviews?hl=en,,negative,0.931,0.68

ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNmdFplYmpRRRAB,"This is my disappointment regarding an incident I encountered at your store. When I attempted to enter, the guard stopped me and stated that helmets were not allowed inside. This policy seems both inconvenient and counterproductive, as it alienates customers and creates unnecessary friction.  A helmet is personal property, often carried for safety, especially for those commuting by bike or scooter. Denying entry to customers with helmets is not only inconvenient but also unfair to responsible patrons who simply wish to shop. Such restrictions might deter people from visiting your store, ultimately affecting your customer base and revenue.  I fail to see how such a policy contributes to a welcoming and customer-friendly environment. Growing a business requires fostering goodwill, convenience, and satisfaction—not imposing rules that frustrate paying customers.  I urge you to reconsider this approach and implement a more customer-centric policy. Providing a secure place for helmets or allowing them inside would demonstrate a commitment to customer comfort and encourage repeat visits.  I hope this feedback is taken constructively, and I look forward to seeing positive changes.",10 months ago,2025-11-04 16:07:13.388249,1.0,Rahul Tiwari,21,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114347258098155020771/reviews?hl=en,,negative,0.62,0.63
